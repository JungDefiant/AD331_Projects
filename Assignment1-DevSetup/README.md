Written by Bade Habib

### Libraries Used
- numpy v2.1.3
- pandas v2.2.3
- matplotlib v3.10.0

### Summary of Data Exploration
Through the exploration of the Iris dataset, I discovered the following about the data.
- Setosa has the smallest petal length, much lower than versicolor and virginica.
- Setosa tends to have a much wider sepal than the other species.
- Virginica tends to have the longest sepal and petal out of all the species.
- Both virginica and versicolor tend to have similar sized sepals.
- Sepal widths tend to have a more cluttered distribution between the species, while all other features are more scattered.
